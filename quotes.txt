- Revenge is a dish best served cold.
- Only a fool continues to fight in a burning house.
- A targ is only as honorable as its master.
- Battle your enemies and your women, but let your women win.
- The wind does not respect a fool.
- Four thousand throats may be cut in one night by a running man.
- A fool and his head are soon parted.
- Destroying an empire to win a war is no victory. Ending a battle to save an empire
  is no defeat.
- A leader is not judged by the length of his reign, but the decisions he makes.
- Death is an experienced best shared.
- A sharp knife is nothing without a sharp eye.
- To those who are overly cautious, everything is impossible.
- What is good? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you and hear the lamentations
  of their women.
